# PHP Easy Journal

**PHP Easy Journal** is a minimalist **free PHP micro blogging script** to post brief data blobs.

Edit the script and adjust the configuration and styles to match your environment and likes. You can add new entries or modify existing ones by calling the script with the editor query set in `$edit`, e.g. `?edit`.
Title and text may contain ASCII art, mark-up, and script, plus media, like images, audio, video, etc. Use your illusion. Everything is kept in plain text files. Hence, no database is required.
